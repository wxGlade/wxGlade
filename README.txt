wxGlade: A GUI builder for wxPython/wxWidgets
=============================================

Version: 0.9.5
License: MIT (see LICENSE.txt)

THIS PROGRAM COMES WITH NO WARRANTY


Requirements
------------

 - Python (http://www.python.org) 2.7, 3.4 or later
 - wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org) >= 2.8
   (wxPython Phoenix, i.e. release >=4.0.0, is supported)

If you have a choice, you should prefer wxPython Phoenix running on Python 3.x.


Installation
------------

To start the program, enter ``python wxglade.py`` in your shell or use
whatever is required to start a python application on your platform.
If you want to build a GUI for wxPython Classic or Phoenix:
Start wxGlade in your target version - if it runs under Phoenix, it will
create Phoenix code.

Version 0.3.1 - 2003-08-30:
 - we found an annoying bug on pl_codegen.py right after releasing 0.3 :-(

Version 0.3   - 2003-08-29:
 - codegen/pl_codegen.py, toolbar/perl_codegen.py, menubar/perl_codegen.py:
     brought Perl code generator up to date:
     - multiple files support
     - ``keep contents'' support
     - automatic ids generation (ID_FOO=?) support
     everything is still *experimental* and NEEDS EXTENSIVE TESTING
 - widgets/toolbar/codegen.py, widgets/bitmap_button/codegen.py,
   widgets/static_bitmap/codegen.py:
     added (limited) support to xpm data (not on files). I.e. if the bitmap
     property is something like var:variable_name, variable_name is taken to
     be a variable that holds xpm data

     added subclass support to XRC output
 - application.py, tree.py, xml_parse.py, codegen/py_codegen.py,
   codegen/cpp_codegen.py:
     added "overwrite" property to Application, to allow 
     re-generation of (C++ and python) code from scratch (as opposed
     to updating wxGlade blocks).
 - docs/tutorial.html:
     updated notes
 - codegen/py_codegen.py, codegen/cpp_codegen.py:
     enhanced generate_code_id, to recognize ID_SOMETHING=? and generate a
     "unique" id automatically
 - codegen/cpp_codegen.py:
     fixed ids code generation when the output file already exists
 - widgets/toolbar.py:
     fixed xrc code generation
 - common.py:
     updated version number to 0.3pre1
 -  edit_windows.py, application.py:
      added validation code for `name' and `class' properties (fixed bug
      #764186)
 - credits.txt:
      updated developer names
 - codegen/py_codegen.py, codegen/cpp_codegen.py:
      fixed bug in quote_str
 -  tree.py, widgets/panel/*:
      added scrolled window support (this required a small change in
      Tree.Node.write in tree.py)
 -  perl generation support added
 -  nearly all around:
      fixed various Unicode-related bugs
 - misc.py
      added functions, streq and wxstr, to fix some Unicode issues
 - edit_windows.py, edit_sizers/edit_sizers.py, xml_parse.py:
      added cut&paste support for toplevel sizers
 - common.py, main.py:

      "custom" ones (similar to Glade and QT-Designer)

1. Setup PyInstaller
--------------------

Install the current version of PyInstaller from http://www.pyinstaller.org.
Follow the instruction published at PyInstallers homepage.

This procedure is tested using PyInstaller versions 1.5 and 1.5.1.

2. Generate an executable
-------------------------

- Open a command prompt and change into source base directory

- To delete temporary Python bytecode files type
  del /S *.pyo
  del /S *.pyc

- Type
  python.exe <path to PyInstaller>\Build.py --noconfirm --buildpath <path to source>\wxglade\build install\pyinstaller\wxglade.spec

  If everything works, you should now have three new subdirectories
  "build", "bdist" and "dist".

- Now you should have a working executable in "bdist", called "wxglade.exe".
  If it works, you can move on to the next step

3. Generate an installer
------------------------

- Download and install Inno Setup from here:
  http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

- To create the installer for the Standalone Edition open
  "wxglade-SAE-installer.iss" with Inno Setup and run it.

- To create the regular installer open "wxglade-installer.iss" with Inno
  Setup and run it.

- If everything works, you should have the installer executables in the
  "dist" directory. "wxGlade-SAE-<version>-setup.exe" is the installer of the
  Standalone Edition. And "wxGlade-<version>-setup.exe" is the regular
  installer.

- All done!
